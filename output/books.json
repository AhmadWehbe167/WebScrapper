    "description": "Social Beings, Future Belongings is a collection of sociological essays that address an increasingly relevant matter: what does belonging look like in the twenty-first century? The book critically explores the concept of belonging and how it can respond to contemporary problems in not only the traditional domains of citizenship and migration, but also in detention practices, queer and feminist politics, Australian literature and fashion, technology, housing and rituals.  Drawing on examples from Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, each topic is examined as a different kind of problem for the future  as a toil, an intensity or a promise. Ultimately, the collection argues that creating new ways to belong in contemporary times means reimagining the traditional terms on which belonging can happen, as well as the social itself. Read on their own, each chapter presents a compelling case study and develops a set of critical tools for encountering the empirical, epistemological and ontological challenges we face today. Read together, they present a diverse imagination that is capable of answering the question of belonging in, to and with the future. Social Beings, Future Belongings shows how belonging is not a static and universal state, but a contingent, emergent and ongoing future-oriented set of practices. Balancing empirical and theoretical work, this book will appeal to researchers, students and practitioners alike.",

    "description": "What Would Freud Do? uses the key ideas of more than 80 psychological thinkers, past and present, to shine new light onto today's everyday problems. Ever wondered what a great therapist like Freud or Jung would have to say about your horrible boss, your phone-checking addiction or an occasional wish to cheat on your partner? Ever wished someone would explain why you sometimes act like an idiot just when you want to look good, or generally keep doing things you don't really want to do?From Erich Fromm on how to find Mr/Mrs Right, to Jaak Panksepp on road rage and Magda Arnold on how to deal with 'banter', these theorists have intriuging suggestions for ways to see and do things differently. Divided into five sections, including 'What am I like?', and 'Why am I acting like this?', other questions include:-'My family's a nightmare -- shall I cut them off?'-'Is my partner lying to me?'-'Why do I keep buying the same brand all the time?'-'How can I stop people unfriending me on social media?'-'Why do I lie when she says \"Does my bum look big in this?\"'With Sarah Tomley's enlightening commentary throughout, this book provides the answers to the most deep and meaningful (or, indeed, shallow and meaningless) questions that you have ever pondered. A pocket guide to facing the hurdles and obstacles of life, with the advice of all the greatest psychologists at your fingertips.",

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacationeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal livesand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

This passionate philosophical novel is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature. The Brothers Karamazov is Dostoevskys deepest contemplation of human existence, which has heavily influenced the existentialist movement lead by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in the middle of twentieth century. A complex structure of the novel features motifs of crime, justice, and redemption through suffering that help Dostoevsky develop his major themes including the conflict between faith and doubt, the burden of free will, and the pervasiveness of moral responsibility. The author's unmatched manner of exploring psychology of his protagonists has influenced many thinkers including Sigmund Freud, who called The Brothers Karamazov the most magnificent novel ever written. Pretty illustrations by Dmitrii Rybalko provide you with new impressions from reading this legendary story.",

Arriving at a time where issues of inflammation and gut health are becoming increasingly prominent within mainstream discourses, Dr Will Cole offers us a solution to this growing issue. The Inflammation Spectrum teaches us that ultimately how we feel is symbiotically linked to what we consume; indeed, food, in Cole's words, 'constantly and dynamically influences' our health. Subsequently he teaches readers how to do nutrition the right way, providing us with a personal guide which seeks to aid readers to find out which foods their bodies love, hate and need to feel great! Cole's book informs us to think twice before consuming pharmaceutical drugs to \"fix\" issues of inflammation and instead proposes that readers reassess their eating habits, using 'food as thy medicine'. This book, Dr Mark Hyman suggests, is for 'anyone who is fed up with fad diets' as Cole uses his years of experience in functional-medicine to teach us how to love our bodies enough to nourish it with delicious, healing foods. From personal quizzes to scientific breakdowns The Inflammation Spectrum offers empowering advice and puts readers on the path to achieving food freedom and optimal health.",

Assets, for example, are mostly valued at market prices whereas liabilities are often measured by established actuarial methods. However, there is a general agreement that the balance sheet of an insurance company should be measured in a consistent way. Market-Consistent Actuarial Valuation presents powerful methods to measure liabilities and assets in a consistent way.

    "price": "$18.95 Ebook",
    "description": "In this definitive biography, Cristina Siccardi situates the appealing figure of young Pier Giorgio Frassati in early 20th century Turin, Italy. In the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Italy where the memory of Savoy is still alive there are two contrasting forms of enterprise: one of older stamp, attentive to the values of patriotism and integrity; the other tending toward ever more acquisitive forms of capitalism.In this environment Pier Giorgio, the young heir of Senator Alfredo Frassati, founder of the newspaper La Stampa, makes his own choice for the social doctrine of the Catholic Church, seeking not so much to solve general problems but to make Christ and the Church more present to those in need. That was the motivation for his assisting in many charitable works of the St. Vincent Society, his support for the Popular Party, and his development of a spirituality of engaged and diligent action. His devotion to friendship and to sports was extraordinary, with a special love for mountain hiking, which was for him both enjoyable exercise and the contemplation of creation, as well as a symbol of his striving for perfection in virtue.Other important aspects that will passionately engage readers of this book include the story of the famous Frassati family, and the marked contrasts among its members--especially the bond of division/union between father and son. Alfredo Frassati, a man of notable accomplishments, will discover, when his widely beloved son dies, a completely new dimension of the world. There follows a spiritual deepening, year after year, which leaves its traces in several letters to Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI. This book describes an extraordinary itinerary of holiness, but also a key to understanding the history of Italy in the 20th century.Pope John Paul II said about Pier Giorgio on the day of his Beatification (20 May, 1990):\"Faith and charity, the true driving forces of his existence, made him active and diligent in the milieu in which he lived, in his family, in the university and society; they transformed him into a joyful apostle of Christ, a passionate follower of his message and charity. The secret of his apostolic zeal and holiness is found in the ascetical and spiritual journey which he traveled; in prayer, in persevering adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, in his thirst for the Word of God; in the peaceful acceptance of life's difficulties; in chastity lived as a cheerful, uncompromising discipline.\"",

In fact, yoga is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the architect of your own joy. A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the path for millions. The term guru, he notes, means dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you perceive and experience life. The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new. Inner Engineering presents a revolutionary way of thinking about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.",

    "description": "After a century of misunderstanding the differences between diet, weight control, and health, The Case for Keto revolutionizes how we think about healthy eating--from the best-selling author of Why We Get Fat and The Case Against Sugar.Based on twenty years of investigative reporting and interviews with 100 practicing physicians who embrace the keto lifestyle as the best prescription for their patients' health, Gary Taubes gives us a manifesto for the twenty-first-century fight against obesity and diabetes.For years, health organizations have preached the same rules for losing weight: restrict your calories, eat less, exercise more. So why doesn't it work for everyone? Taubes, whose seminal book Good Calories, Bad Calories and cover stories for The New York Times Magazine changed the way we look at nutrition and health, sets the record straight.The Case for Keto puts the ketogenic diet movement in the necessary historical and scientific perspective. It makes clear the vital misconceptions in how we've come to think about obesity and diet (no, people do not become fat simply because they eat too much; hormones play the critical role) and uses the collected clinical experience of the medical community to provide essential practical advice. Taubes reveals why the established rules about eating healthy might be the wrong approach to weight loss for millions of people, and how low-carbohydrate, high-fat/ketogenic diets can help so many of us achieve and maintain a healthy weight for life.",

There are a lot of myths about beating stomach bloat and getting a flat tummy, but the FODMAP approach has been scientifically proven to work for both. FODMAPs are sugars found in certain foods that can be hard to digest, and can cause discomfort, gas, and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) symptoms. Some of the most nutritious foods around are high in these sugars, frustrating people who eat well but still have tummy issues. Apples, garlic, onions, beans, dairy, bread, and cereals are on that list. It may sound complicated or far-fetched but the many converts who have tried the science-supported diet swear by it. In addition to useful everyday advice, the book includes:  The differences and similarities between this diet and a gluten-free diet 7-day sample menu plan with recipes Simple and easy recipes for the basic items you need to adapt to fit into the low-FODMAP diet, including staples like salad dressing, marinade, and dips Clear explanations for the science behind the low-FODMAP diet and why it works ",

Its a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice. Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do. Fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year. Today, Nikes annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knights Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last. At twenty-four, Knight decides that rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, new, dynamic, different. He details the many risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors and hostile bankersas well as his many thrilling triumphs. Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers. Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the transformative power of sports, they created a brandand a culturethat changed everything.",

Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide; the question of living or not living in a universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Albert Camus brilliantly posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.",

    "description": "One of the greatest spiritual thinkers of the twentieth century explores the physical and emotional intimacies of men and women in Sex Matters: Sex to Superconsciousness. Sex matters to us all. The Osho approach to sex begins with an understanding of how important love is in our lives, while at the same time acknowledges that the journey into love cannot exclude our innate biological energies. With this perspective, it becomes clear that the tendency for religions, and for society in general, to associate sex with sin and morality has been a great misfortune.Sex Matters begins by deconstructing the layers of sexual repression that the condemnation of sex has inflicted on humans. Throughout the bookin response to questions about everything from jealousy to premature ejaculation, the role of intimacy and the differences between men and womenOsho proposes a vision that embraces sex as a fundamental gift from nature. We learn how orgasm offers a glimpse of timelessness, thoughtlessness, and pure awarenessbiologys way of pointing toward the consciousness that helps us to understand ourselves.Finally, we are presented with a clear choice: a repressed sexuality that leads to pornography, perversion, and a stunted humanity or a playful, respectful, and relaxed innocence that supports us in becoming fulfilled and whole, as nature intended.Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the 1000 Makers of the 20th Century and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten peoplealong with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddhawho have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.",

Or that a true artist works alone? In Real Artists Dont Starve, author and creativity expert Jeff Goins has set out to replace these false narratives and replace them with timeless strategies for thriving as a creative and debunking the myth of the starving artist.From graphic designers and writers to artists and business professionals, creatives already know that no one is born an artist. Instead, those who have entered a creative field have already utilized the imagination in fundamental ways in order to accomplish what they have thus far. And contrary to popular myth, Goins believes their artistic temperament has actually given them a competitive advantage in the marketplace.Through inspiring anecdotes of successful creatives both past and present, Goins explores the tension every creative person and organization faces in an effort to blend the inspired life with a practical path to success. Being creative isnt a disadvantage for success; rather, it is a powerful tool to be harnessed.",

Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.\"The next step in fiction...Edgy, accurate, and darkly witty...Think Beckett, think Pynchon, think Gaddis.

But four years earlier, she came to Dex seeking comfort and then disappeared like a thief in the night, leaving him a broken man.Dex Remington is one of the top PC game developers in the United States. He's handsome, smart, and numb. So damn numb that he's not sure he'll ever find a reason to feel again.A chance encounter sparks intense desires in Ellie and Dex.

Is it possible to cross a burned bridge, or are they destined to be apart forever?***In STROKE OF LOVEKate Paletto runs a volunteer program in Belize for Artists for International Aid, where she deals with self-centered artists who use the program as a means to repair their marred reputations. She loves the country, the people, and what AIA stands for, but too many diva volunteers have turned her off to press-seeking celebrities altogether and left her questioning the value of the volunteer program. When she meets incredibly handsome and charming Sage, he stirs emotions she hasn't felt for ages, even though he represents the things she despises.Laid-back artist Sage Remington escapes his wealthy lifestyle in the Big Apple for a two-week journey of self-discovery to figure out how a guy who has so much can feel so empty. When he meets ultra-organized Kate, who lives her life the way he's always dreamed of living his, the attraction is too hot to ignore, but Sage is there to figure out what's missing in his life, not to find a woman.Every look, and every late-night chat in the romantic jungle brings them closer together, but Sage can barely think past stripping away Kate's misconceptions about him. Kate fights him every step of the way--even though she finds it hard to ignore the strikingly handsome, generous-to-a-fault artist who wants to do nothing more than right the wrongs of the world--and love her to the ends of the earth.***IN FLAMES OF LOVE...As one of New York's Finest, firefighter Cash Ryder is always prepared. When a woman's car skids off the side of a mountain during a snowstorm, he's there to rescue her.

When she's rescued by a tall, handsome stranger, she thinks that maybe, just maybe, she's found her own real-life romantic fairy tale--until he opens his mouth and everything that comes out is gruff, ornery, and aggravatingly sexy.Thrown together during an annual firehouse calendar photo shoot, the passion between Cash and Siena sizzles, and neither one knows how to control the flames. After an evening of verbal sparring followed by a sinfully sensual night, their darkest secrets are revealed--and so is Cash's warm, romantic heart. But Siena's secret might be too much for big, strong, always-prepared Cash to handle--and Siena is forced to choose between a man who's everything she's ever dreamed of and an opportunity of a lifetime.***The Remingtons are the third installment of the Love in Bloom Series (Voted BEST BOOK SERIES by Supportive Business Moms, UK) written by New York Times & USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster.
